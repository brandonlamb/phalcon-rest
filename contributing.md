# Introduction
This is an attempt to lay out a roadmap of sorts.

## Insipiration
While doing some initial research before starting a new API project, the following resources were deemed very good:

# Support for API versions
A good API will support versionioning, making it easier for consumers to upgrade.

* Support url version mapping
* Support media type version mapping

# Resource based api mapping

* Resource/Collection
* Resource/Instance

# Support for multiple response types

* JSON (default)
* CSV
* XML

# Attempt swappable DBAL

* Spot
* Phalcon

# Advanced resource routing

* /v1/resource/id/relation/relationId
